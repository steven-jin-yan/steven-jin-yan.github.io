**Nice to meet you!** 

I am 顏錦 ([jɛn˧˥tɕɪn˨˩˦] in Mandarin and [ŋaŋ˨kim˧˧˨] in Eastern Min Chinese), or you can call me Steven.

I will be a PhD student in linguistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) from August, 2025. My research interest is mainly on formal linguistics, especially on the Minimalist Program and Chinese syntax. 
I am also a member of [Prof. Victor Pan's lab](https://victorjunnanpan.github.io/pansyntaxlab/).

**Languages**: Chinese (native, Mandarin/Eastern Min), English (proficient), French (intermediate), Spanish (basic)
