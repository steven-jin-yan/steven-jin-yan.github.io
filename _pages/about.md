**Nice to meet you!** 

I am 顏錦 (YAN Jin, [jɛn˧˥tɕɪn˨˩˦] in Mandarin and [ŋaŋ˨kim˧˧˨] in Eastern Min Chinese), or you can call me Steven.

I am a PhD student in linguistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) from August, 2025, under the supervision of Professor [Victor Junnan PAN](https://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty-linguistics/pan-victor-junnan-personal-website/), and I am a member of [Prof. Victor Pan's lab](https://victorjunnanpan.github.io/pansyntaxlab/). My research interest is mainly on formal linguistics, especially on the Minimalist Program and Chinese syntax, including:

  * Syntax-discourse interface (discourse particles in Chinese dialects)
  * A/A'-distinction
  * Free-Merge

Besides, I am also exploring neurolinguistics, looking forward to explaining human languages from a different perspective.

**Languages**: Chinese (native, Mandarin/Eastern Min), English (proficient), French (intermediate), Spanish (basic).
