**Nice to meet you!** 

I am 顏錦 ([jɛn˧˥tɕɪn˨˩˦] in Mandarin and [ŋaŋ˨kim˧˧˨] in Eastern Min Chinese), or you can call me Steven.

I will be a PhD student in linguistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) from August, 2025. I am also a member of [Prof. Victor Pan's lab](https://victorjunnanpan.github.io/pansyntaxlab/). My research interest is mainly on formal linguistics, especially on the Minimalist Program and Chinese syntax, including:
  * The Left Periphery
  * Discourse particles: sentence-initial/middle/final particles in Chinese dialects, Italian, German and West-Flemish
  * Free-Merge, Multi-dimensional Merge

**Languages**: Chinese (native, Mandarin/Eastern Min), English (proficient), French (intermediate), Spanish (basic).
