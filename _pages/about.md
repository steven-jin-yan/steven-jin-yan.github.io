Nice to meet you! 
I will be a PhD student linguistics in The Chinese University of Hong Kong from August, 2025. My research interest is mainly about formal linguistics, especially on the A-bar dependency under Minimalist Program. 
I am also a member of [Pan's lab](https://victorjunnanpan.github.io/pansyntaxlab/).
